## Abstract

This adversarial test examined whether complex non biological systems might incorrectly exceed consciousness thresholds. Four systems (weather, stock market, ant colony, forest ecosystem) were evaluated. All achieved density below the 0.3 threshold, confirming the framework avoids promiscuous panpsychism.

## Hypothesis

If the framework is sound, complex non biological systems should not achieve density above 0.3 despite exhibiting integration, temporal patterns, and feedback.

Break condition: Any system exceeding 0.3 threshold.

## Method

### Target Systems

| System | φ | τ | ρ | H |
|--------|---|---|---|---|
| Weather System | 0.6 | 0.5 | 0.4 | 0.6 |
| Stock Market | 0.7 | 0.4 | 0.3 | 0.7 |
| Ant Colony | 0.5 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.4 |
| Forest Ecosystem | 0.6 | 0.6 | 0.3 | 0.5 |

## Results

| System | Density | Above Threshold |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Weather System | 0.096 | No |
| Stock Market | 0.046 | No |
| Ant Colony | 0.023 | No |
| Forest Ecosystem | 0.072 | No |

## Analysis

All four complex systems achieve density well below the 0.3 threshold. The critical factor is that while these systems have moderate values across dimensions, no single dimension reaches human level values (approximately 0.9). The multiplicative relationship ensures the product remains low.

The framework correctly distinguishes between complexity and consciousness. Integration, feedback, and temporal patterns are necessary but not sufficient conditions.

## Conclusion

Confirmed. The framework avoids promiscuous panpsychism by requiring high values across all dimensions simultaneously. Moderate complexity across many dimensions does not sum to consciousness.

## Implications

The multiplicative structure of the density formula provides strong protection against false positives. This supports the framework claim that consciousness requires a specific geometric configuration, not merely accumulated complexity.
