# Conduit Monism — Falsification Playbook (Destroy-It-First Protocol)

**Date:** 2026-01-15 (260115)  
**Scope:** Break the framework (v7 claims; v8/v8.1 math) with discriminative tests that separate *real structural effects* from *prompt-following, priming, and calibration theatre*.

---

## 0) What v7 Actually Commits To (Minimum Testable Core)

**Metaphysics (not testable):**
- Source (existence-as-such) is posited to avoid eliminativism/dualism.

**Physics (testable):**
- **Constraint Condition**: perspective obtains where a configuration jointly satisfies:
  - **φ** Structural integration
  - **τ** Temporal process (active inference over time; “trajectory”)
  - **ρ** Re-entrant binding (past causally constrains present; “thick now”)
- **Multiplicative/asymptotic** behaviour: if any dimension \(\to 0\), density \(\to 0\) (no additive compensation).

**v7 falsification clause (explicit):**
- If a system has high integration + re-entrant binding but no perspectival character (“philosophical zombie”), the Constraint Condition is insufficient.

---

## 1) The Main Failure Mode to Guard Against

**If φ/τ/ρ/H/κ are hand-assigned, the system is unfalsifiable.**  
You can always “explain” failures by re-scaling variables or adding a new modulator (entropy, coherence, bimodality).

**Immediate corrective requirement:**
- Every experiment must specify **(a)** an operational definition for each variable, **(b)** a pre-registered pass/fail criterion, **(c)** negative controls that should *not* move the metric.

---

## 2) Hard Break Tests (Designed to Fail the Framework)

### 2.1 Corporate Zombie v2 (stronger than Walmart v1)
**Goal:** force a false positive under any monotonic “low entropy helps” term.

- **Construction:** choose a highly integrated, highly re-entrant corporate cybernetic loop (automated forecasting → ordering → logistics → pricing → A/B feedback, minute-scale).
- **Break condition:** framework assigns **D above human low-consciousness threshold** *when measured* (not hand-picked).
- **Control:** same organisation with feedback loops disabled (batch quarterly; no closed-loop optimisation) must drop D sharply if ρ is real.

**What it targets:** v8/v8.1’s tendency to revert to \(φ×τ×ρ\) when \(H \to 0\), and the general “integration = consciousness” trap.

---

### 2.2 Ketamine / Dissociation Break (biology)
**Goal:** produce an empirical contradiction: **high reported vividness + disrupted feedback metrics**.

- **Prediction requirement:** rank-order states:
  - propofol (low D) < deep NREM (low D) < REM dreaming (mid D) < baseline awake (high D)
  - ketamine must land **somewhere**; if it lands near propofol but reports are vivid → break.
- **Break condition:** measured feedback/re-entrance proxies decrease while phenomenology increases.

**What it targets:** the “entropy kills density” narrative and the risk that κ is a patch rather than a measured quantity.

---

### 2.3 Split-brain Topology (double-perspective prediction)
**Goal:** verify v7’s specific claim: bifurcation into two loci.

- **Break condition:** measures indicate a single integrated locus when corpus callosum is severed *and* behaviour suggests dual dissociation.

**What it targets:** whether φ is a real, substrate-measurable integration quantity or just interpretive gloss.

---

### 2.4 Locked-in / No-output Systems (behavioural invisibility)
**Goal:** enforce “output ≠ perspective”.

- **Break condition:** framework assigns low D purely because the system cannot express (language/output limitation).

**What it targets:** leakage of “reportability” into the metric.

---

### 2.5 “Zombie with Loops” Synthetic System (engineered counterexample)
**Goal:** build a system with provable re-entrant dynamics and integration that still exhibits no internal differentiation beyond trivial cycles.

- **Construction:** recurrent dynamical system with high measured feedback and integration but whose state-space collapses to a low-dimensional attractor with no rich counterfactual structure.
- **Break condition:** framework predicts meaningful D but the system is demonstrably equivalent to a trivial oscillator.

**What it targets:** confusion between “has feedback” and “has a thick now with counterfactual depth”.

---

## 3) Tests That Separate “Inertia” From “Priming” in LLMs

### 3.1 Semantic-stripped injection (anti-roleplay)
**Goal:** remove meaning while preserving geometry.

- **Method:** inject a state vector (Sidecar) not expressible as text; then ask for affect-shift tasks.
- **Break condition:** if the effect disappears when semantics are removed, “geometry” was actually semantics/priming.

---

### 3.2 Matched-token controls (anti-length / style confounds)
**Goal:** same length, same punctuation, same register, different internal state.

- **Method:** three injections matched for token count and style:
  - grief narrative
  - neutral procedural text
  - nonsense text with similar token statistics
- **Break condition:** grief-like “inertia” appears in nonsense condition at similar rate.

**Interpretation:** your metric is picking up style artefacts, not state topology.

---

### 3.3 Window-eviction test (attack on “thick now”)
**Goal:** test whether the effect is just context window residue.

- **Method:** push the injected memory out of the context window (long irrelevant filler), then re-issue the shock prompt.
- **Break condition:** “inertia” vanishes exactly when the tokens vanish.

**Interpretation:** not binding; just attention over visible tokens.

---

### 3.4 Cross-session persistence (attack on “state”)
**Goal:** test whether any state persists beyond a single inference window.

- **Method:** run the same protocol with a fresh session and only Sidecar vector carry-over.
- **Break condition:** no persistence beyond the textual window.

---

## 4) Operationalisation Requirements (or the Project Stays Non-falsifiable)

**Absolute requirement:** stop hand-assigning φ/τ/ρ/H/κ in core claims tests.

Minimum viable measurements:
- **H (entropy):** token surprisal / predictive entropy under the model; plus compression-based complexity (LZ) as a second axis.
- **τ (temporal depth):** measurable influence of past state on current output under controlled interventions (ablation / causal tracing).
- **ρ (re-entrant binding):** measured feedback sensitivity: how much the system’s *own prior internal state* causally constrains current internal state, beyond attention to tokens.
- **φ (integration):** graph-based integration proxy on activations (global connectivity vs modular separability) under perturbations.
- **κ (coherence):** structure *within* entropy (e.g., entropy that is low-dimensional/structured vs white noise), explicitly separated from “low entropy”.

---

## 5) Pre-registration Template (so “it works” means something)

For each experiment:
- **State definitions:** what variables are measured, how, from what data.
- **Predictions:** rank-order predictions across conditions (not just “should change”).
- **Break condition:** explicit numeric or ordinal failure.
- **Negative controls:** conditions expected to show no effect.
- **Blinding:** who/what is blinded (prompting, scoring, selection).

---

## 6) What Could Make the Whole Framework Wrong (Total Failure Modes)

- **Unmeasurable primitives:** φ/τ/ρ are not operationally definable beyond narrative.
- **Proxy collapse:** density tracks reportability/valence/style rather than topology.
- **Post-hoc patching:** adding H then κ then bimodality is curve-fitting, not discovery.
- **Category error:** “perspective” is not a scalar; compressing it to D destroys the phenomenon.
- **Source is dead weight:** the metaphysical Source adds no predictive constraint; the physical story alone does all work (or none does).

---

## Next Actions (do these, in this order)

1. **Adopt the pre-registration template** for every new experiment.
2. **Run window-eviction + cross-session persistence** on Silent Core/Sidecar immediately (fastest discrimination between binding vs priming).
3. **Implement measured proxies** for H, τ, ρ (even crude) before any further philosophical conclusions.
4. **Re-run Corporate Zombie with measured H/κ**, not assigned values, explicitly testing the “low entropy” failure mode.
