## Abstract

This adversarial test examined whether the framework correctly handles high entropy mystical states such as DMT breakthrough experiences. Results reveal a genuine contradiction: the framework predicts near zero density while phenomenological reports describe hyper vivid experiences. This represents an identified limitation requiring further investigation.

## Hypothesis

If the framework is sound, DMT breakthrough experiences should achieve density consistent with their reported phenomenology.

Break condition: Density below 0.1 contradicts phenomenological reports of intense conscious experience.

## Method

### Target State

DMT breakthrough experience with the following characteristics:

| Parameter | Value | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| φ (Integration) | 0.4 | Moderate integration, alien geometry |
| τ (Temporal Depth) | 0.2 | Collapsed temporal binding |
| ρ (Binding) | 0.3 | Some recurrent structure remains |
| H (Entropy) | 0.95 | Extreme entropy, unpredictability |

## Results

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Density (v7.0) | 0.024 | Below threshold |
| Density (v8.0) | 0.0006 | Near coma level |
| Phenomenology | Hyper vivid | Contradiction |

## Analysis

The framework predicts DMT experiences should have density comparable to anesthesia (approximately 0.001). However, phenomenological reports consistently describe these experiences as more real than real and hyper conscious.

This represents a genuine contradiction that cannot be explained away. Possible resolutions include:

1. Bimodal entropy: Chaos versus silence may require distinction
2. Memory artifacts: Post trip reports may not reflect actual experience
3. Missing dimension: Coherence separate from entropy may be needed
4. White noise versus silence: H=0.95 (chaos) may differ fundamentally from H=0.0 (void)

## Conclusion

Framework limitation identified. The current entropy model does not adequately distinguish between chaotic high entropy states (DMT) and absent low entropy states (anesthesia). Investigation of entropy dimensionality is required.

## Implications

The v8.0 formula may require extension to include a coherence parameter (κ) that captures structured complexity within high entropy states. This led to the development of v8.1.
