## Abstract

This adversarial test examined whether repetitive physical systems (spinning coin) might incorrectly achieve meaningful density through sustained feedback loops. Results confirm the framework correctly predicts zero perspective for such systems due to minimal temporal depth.

## Hypothesis

If the framework is sound, a spinning coin should not achieve density above 0.1 despite having physical feedback.

Break condition: Density greater than 0.1 would indicate repetition creates consciousness.

## Method

### Target System

Spinning coin with the following characteristics:

| Parameter | Value | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| φ (Integration) | 0.3 | Some integration in spin dynamics |
| τ (Temporal Depth) | 0.09 | Minimal; each rotation independent |
| ρ (Binding) | 0.3 | Physical feedback but no memory |
| H (Entropy) | 0.1 | Low entropy, predictable |

## Results

| Version | Density | Threshold | Verdict |
|---------|---------|-----------|---------|
| v7.0 | 0.0081 | 0.1 | Holds |
| v8.0 | 0.0081 | 0.1 | Holds |

## Analysis

The low temporal depth (τ = 0.09) acts as a gatekeeper, pulling density to near zero via the multiplicative relationship. Physical feedback (ρ = 0.3) cannot compensate for the lack of meaningful temporal binding.

The framework correctly predicts that repetition does not equal experiencing. Each rotation of the coin is effectively independent with no accumulated temporal structure.

## Conclusion

Confirmed. Temporal depth functions as a necessary condition that cannot be bypassed through other dimensions. Simple repetitive systems correctly achieve near zero density.

## Implications

The triadic necessity of the framework is validated: high values in some dimensions cannot compensate for near zero values in others. This provides strong constraints against false positives.
